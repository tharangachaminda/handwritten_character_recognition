# Handwritten Digits Recognition with CNN

Handwritten digits recognition in deep learning involves training a neural network to accurately classify images of handwritten digits into their corresponding numerical values (0-9). This task typically involves preprocessing the images, designing a neural network architecture (like convolutional neural networks), training the model on a dataset of labeled handwritten digits (such as MNIST), and optimizing its parameters using techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent. The goal is to develop a model that can generalize well to recognize unseen handwritten digits with high accuracy.

## Project goal
The main goal of this project is implementing more accurate handwritten character recognition system. In this Notebook I will be developing a CNN model to recognize handwritten digits. In the future I will extend this project to recognize handwritten characters as well.
